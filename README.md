# Tic Tac Toe Game using Minimax Algorithm
This is the most basic game for understanding how a simple AI work. For those who are interested go for AI, they have to understand this game. I made this game using Minimax Algorithm. ALthough, this is not the only approach to code this game.
Prerequisite:
1. Basic understanding of Python
2. Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax file of this repository contains the implementation of minimax Algorithm.
To understand this algoritm, you can refer geek for geek or go for this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI
Previous Call of this repository contains contains the other functions which is to be used in making this game.
